## Summary

This PowerShell function checks if Git is available on the system and if the current directory is a Git repository. If both conditions are met, it retrieves the colored diff output using the `git diff` command. If there are changes detected, it creates a message with the diff output and copies it to the clipboard using the `ClipboardHelper` class. 

**My Use Case**

I utilize this tool to streamline the process of generating my commit summary and description for OpenAI browser client (when appropriate). It eliminates the need for manually orchestrating and piecing together various components to create the prompt each time, making the workflow more efficient and straightforward.

**Example Usage**

```powershell
CopyGitDiffPromptToClipboard
```

## Code Analysis

**Inputs**
- None

**Flow**
1. The function checks if Git is available on the system by using the `Get-Command` cmdlet with the `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` parameter.
2. If Git is not found, an error message is displayed, and the function returns.
3. The function then checks if the current directory is a Git repository by using the `Test-Path` cmdlet with the `-PathType Container` parameter and the `.git` folder as the path.
4. If the current directory is not a Git repository, an error message is displayed, and the function returns.
5. The function uses the `git diff` command with the `--color=always` and `HEAD` arguments to retrieve the colored diff output.
6. If an error occurs while getting the diff output, an error message is displayed, and the function returns.
7. The function checks if there are any changes by checking if the diff output is empty.
8. If there are no changes, a message is displayed, and the function returns.
9. If there are changes, a message is created with the diff output and copied to the clipboard using the `[Clipboard]::SetText()` method.
10. If an error occurs while copying the message to the clipboard, an error message is displayed.
